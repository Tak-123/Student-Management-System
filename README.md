# Student-Management-System
This project is a Student Management System developed in Java, utilizing a Database Management System (DBMS) for storing and managing student records. The system provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to manage student data efficiently.
Key Features:
Add Student: Insert new student details into the database (e.g., name, age, class, and address).
Update Student: Modify details of an existing student using their unique student ID.
Delete Student: Remove a student’s record permanently from the database.
View Students: Display all student records stored in the database.
Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Java (JDK 8+)
Database: MySQL / SQLite (or any relational DBMS)
Database Connectivity: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans
How It Works:
Database Setup: A relational database (e.g., MySQL) is used to store student records, and the application interacts with it using SQL queries via JDBC.
Java Application: The user interface is a simple console-based or GUI-based system (Swing/JavaFX) for administrators to interact with the database.
CRUD Operations: Administrators can add, update, delete, and view student data, which gets stored or retrieved from the database.
Database Schema:
Student Table: Stores the student’s unique ID, name, age, class, address, and contact details.
